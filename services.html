    <p class="codeText"><span style="color: #fc8b00;">Moon Base!</span><br><br><br><br>
      
      We're making our very own moon base! Isn't that exciting? We still need a flag... <br><br>
    But it's gonna have turrets that are programmed to shoot anyone the clones in charge of security tell them to. Or, if there's a giant invasion, <br><br>
    we can program it to shoot anything in sight. We're taking the tank up there too. The base is going to look like the top part of the Seattle Space Needle. <br><br>
    We're gonna fill it with plants so that there will be a little more oxygen for the clones living up there. And of course, we're still making the robot soldiers. <br><br>
    I'll hopefully be able to make it my new base soon. That would be fun. And there's less gravity. <br><br><br><br>
    Which will make jumping way more fun. Whee! I can just imagine it now.</p>

    <p class="codeText"><span style="color: #fc8b00;">We Have a Tank!</span><br><br><br><br>
      
      We finally built that tank I was talking about in the last post. It's built! And I added two of Sieger's Plasma guns. <br><br>
      I'm also colonizing the Moon! And Mars. But Moon first. We'll be sending our first ship tomorrow. Every now and then we're gonna send big bottles<br><br>
      of oxygen, but we're also putting plants everywhere to make some oxygen. But I'm so excited about the tank! I can't wait to blow something up with it! <br><br>
      Soon we will have colonized the moon!</p>

    <p class="codeText"><span style="color: #fc8b00;">More Space Missions!</span><br><br><br><br>
      
      Seeing as that mission was so successful, we decided to try it again. We'll launch the rocket to space at 12 P.M. IST. Our goal?<br><br> 
      More recources! And claiming mars for our very own! Then (hopefully) they'll come straight back and tell us what they'd done. In the meantime I'll <br><br>
      play Risk with Muffin (My Faithful Advisor). I hear it's a strategy game. This may not go so well for me. Sieger gave me Lazer weapons, so I'm installing<br><br> 
      those into the robot soldier's shoulders instead of the other guns.<br><br>
      I wonder if there's a Batcat. There should be. Because I'm the hero the universe deserves... Not the one it needs.</p>

    <p class="codeText"><span style="color: #fc8b00;">Back From Space!</span><br><br><br><br>
      
      I am so excited! Our mission to space was successful, though we never say any alien life. Of any kind. But still, we got lots of stuff!<br><br> 
      And they brought moon rocks back for the clones. Yay, Moon rocks! Pretty much all they did was explore. And bring back Gold! Ssshhhiiinnnyyyy....<br><br>
      So that is what we did. Also, we kinda need a flag. If someone could make a flag, that'd be great. Then we could stick it on the moon.<br><br>
      Ffflllaaagggsss.... But anyway, we have gggooolllddd.... And rrroooccckkksss.... For some reason I'm putting down tttrrriiipppllleee letters. I need to stop.<br><br><br><br>
      So yeah. Also, we're building tanks! And robots! I forgot to mention the robot fake fur is black. And the metal is also black. And the eyes glow red.<br><br>
      I already said that. And I've taken up glass blowing. Why? Because glass is pretty. And ssshhhiiinnnyyy.... There I go again! But back to the tanks.<br><br>
      There's gonna be a big gun on top, Miniguns on the sides of that gun, 2 rocket launchers on the sides because why not, and It's gonna be 20 feet long.<br><br>
      For all your house wrecking needs!</p>

    <p class="codeText"><span style="color: #fc8b00;">Journey to Space!</span><br><br><br><br>
      
    I have decided that going into space is not a bad idea. Muffin (My faithful advisor) has deemed it wise to send 30 clones and ten Robot soldiers<br><br>
    in each ship. We plan on claiming planets for ourselves. And getting metals. We happen to need those. Eventually we'll colonize the planets,<br><br>
    but we currently do not possess the technology to do that. Yet. Soon we will rule the solar system!<br><br><br><br> 
    
    Mwahahahaha! Hahahahaha! Ha! Heh. Heh. *Hack*. Hairball.<br><br><br><br> 
      
    Haven't had one of those in a long, long time. Anyway, I'm off to go prepare the spaceship. The front yard would do nicely as a takeoff pad...</p>
